## [v3.5] 2026-05-30 — Lock screen UX rework, encoding fixes, budget sync fix

**What changed:** Reworked the locked quick expense UX, fixed widespread UTF-8 encoding corruption in dashboard.js, and fixed a budget field sync bug where a device with no budget could overwrite a real budget from another device.

**Files modified:**
- `index.html` — replaced the floating `+` button and inline lock-screen form with a `circle-plus` keypad key (bottom-right, same style as biometric key); moved delete to a small `x` inline beside the PIN dots; added `#lockedExpenseSheet` slide-up sheet with full add-expense form (big amount input, category, payment, date pre-filled today, note, active trip badge).
- `js/auth.js` — added `openLockedExpenseSheet()`, `closeLockedExpenseSheet()`, `closeLockedExpenseSheetOutside()`; `submitLockedQuickExpense()` now saves to normal ledger when no active trip is detected (removed trip-only block); `lockApp()` closes sheet on lock; `unlockApp()` closes sheet on unlock.
- `js/dashboard.js` — fixed widespread UTF-8 double-encoding corruption: 284× `──` section dividers, 11× `–` en dashes, 3× `·` middle dots, 2× `→` arrows, 1× `🔔` bell emoji; stripped BOM from file header. All emojis (😄 😱 😰 😟 😐 🙂 🎯) confirmed clean.
- `js/sync.js` — fixed `buildMergedSyncState()` budget merge: `monthlyBudget` now prefers the non-zero value regardless of timestamp; a device with `monthlyBudget: 0` can no longer overwrite a real budget from another device.
- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `working.md` — updated docs.

**Behavior:**
- Lock screen keypad bottom row: `[biometric] [0] [circle-plus]`. Tapping the `circle-plus` key opens the expense sheet; the sheet pre-fills today's date, focuses the amount field, shows a trip badge if an active trip is detected. Saving routes to the active trip or the normal ledger.
- Budget sync: highest non-zero budget wins on merge, regardless of which device has the newer `updatedAt`.
- PWA reminder limitation documented: `scheduleDailyReminder()` uses `setTimeout` and requires the browser tab to be active; background/screen-off firing requires a native wrapper (Capacitor) or server-push. Noted for future Capacitor migration.

## [v3.4] 2026-05-30 - Hosted web app enablement

**What changed:** Enabled hosted-web security and reminder features, added lock-screen active-trip quick expense, moved reset controls to the final Settings panel, and fixed reset-marker follow-up behavior.

**Files modified:**
- `index.html` - moved reset panel to the bottom of Settings; added biometric Settings toggle/status, reminder test notification button, and locked quick expense form.
- `js/auth.js` - replaced simulated biometrics with WebAuthn/passkey unlock; added locked quick expense form population and active-trip-only save behavior.
- `js/core.js` - added biometric/reminder state defaults and service worker registration.
- `js/dashboard.js` - upgraded reminders with service-worker notification delivery, missed-reminder checks, and test notification support.
- `js/sync.js` - preserves local biometric metadata during remote apply; resolves cloud reset markers to a fresh post-reset cloud state when another device chooses Reset This Device Too.
- `sw.js` - added service worker notification click handling.
- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md`, `working.md` - documented Phase 9 behavior.

**Behavior:** Biometric unlock is device-local WebAuthn with PIN fallback. Daily reminders are browser/PWA notifications with a missed-reminder check on app open. Locked quick expense saves only to active trips; normal expenses require unlocking.

## [v3.3] 2026-05-30 - Full reset control

**What changed:** Added a dedicated Settings Danger Zone for destructive reset actions and cross-device reset handling.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` - added `renderResetDangerZone()`, `resetAllData()`, reset markers, `syncEpoch` lineage, and reset-boundary choice modals. Cloud-only reset is disabled unless Drive sync is connected, while Full Reset remains visible for local-only factory reset.
- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md` - documented the difference between Reset Sync and Full Reset.

**Behavior:** Full reset replaces the cloud backup with a reset marker when possible, removes `androidWalletState_v4` from localStorage, clears `trex_onboarding_seen` from sessionStorage, and reloads the app to defaults. Other devices must explicitly choose reset local / make local main, or force cloud / force local / force merge if newer post-reset cloud data exists.
## [v3.2] 2026-05-30 - Repo rename follow-through and new sync file

**What changed:** Completed the follow-up after renaming the folder/repo to **TReX** and intentionally moved test cloud sync to a new Drive file.

**Files modified:**
- `README.md` - updated live app and repository links to `ravitejbondada/TReX`.
- `js/sync.js` - renamed Drive sync file from `dabbux_sync_v4.json` to `trex_sync_v4.json`, onboarding session key from `dabbux_onboarding_seen` to `trex_onboarding_seen`, and GIS ready callback from `_dabbuxGISReady` to `_trexGISReady`.
- `index.html` - updated displayed Drive target and GIS script `onload` callback.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md`, `working.md` - updated sync filename/session key/callback references.

**Migration note:** Existing test data in the old `dabbux_sync_v4.json` Drive file will not be read by this version. A fresh `trex_sync_v4.json` file will be created on next connect/sync.
## [v3.1] 2026-05-30 — Rebrand app to TReX

**What changed:** Updated the current app brand from DabbuX to **TReX** with the tagline **Devour Your Expenses**.

**Files modified:**
- `index.html` — updated document title, Apple web app title, header brand/tagline, lock screen title, image alt text, and report-visible brand text.
- `manifest.json` — updated PWA name and short name.
- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md`, `working.md`, `Cloud Sync Integration Plan.md` — updated current-facing project names/headings.
- `js/*.js` — updated current file headers, notifications, backup export labels, sync copy, and PDF report branding.

**Compatibility notes:**
- Initial rebrand kept compatibility-critical names temporarily; v3.2 intentionally moves the test sync file/session key/repo URLs to TReX names.

## [v3.0] 2026-05-30 — Documentation reconciliation for sync and PDF reports

**What changed:** Brought the project docs back in line with the current code after recent sync and Reports changes.

**Files modified:**
- `README.md` — updated Cloud Sync behaviour to describe multi-device reconciliation, full sync-state preservation, always-visible header icon, and PDF report export.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — updated sync conflict flow, OAuth scopes, header icon behaviour, and Migration modal semantics.
- `FUNCTIONS.md` — added `generatePDFReport()`, sync reconciliation helpers, `normalizeSyncState()`, and `formatTimeAgo()`; updated function counts.
- `working.md` — removed stale PDF button/CDN pending notes; left only dynamic report-cycle selector as pending.

## [v2.9] 2026-05-30 — Preserve full Drive state during remote apply

**What changed:** Fixed the bug that could disable Credit Cards again after sync even when reconciliation had preserved `creditCardsEnabled=true`.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — replaced use of `normalizeImportedState()` inside `applyRemoteState()` with a sync-specific `normalizeSyncState()` that preserves the full live app state shape.
- `js/sync.js` — prevents Drive sync from dropping fields that the backup importer does not include, including `creditCardsEnabled`, `emis`, sync metadata, and alert/reminder settings.

**Verification:**
- Browser apply test confirms a remote state with `creditCardsEnabled=true` remains enabled locally.
- Browser apply test confirms Settings toggle updates to checked immediately.
- Browser apply test confirms EMIs survive remote apply.

## [v2.8] 2026-05-30 — Sync settings, categories, payments, and credit card mode

**What changed:** Fixed remaining multi-device sync gaps where Settings changes could fail to appear on another device even when both devices pointed at the same Drive file.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — extended reconciliation to merge `categories` and `payments` by stable `id`, not only transaction-style records.
- `js/sync.js` — added shared-setting reconciliation for currency, budget cycle settings, theme, reminder settings, and budget alert settings using the newer state.
- `js/sync.js` — treats `creditCardsEnabled=true` as shared across devices so a stale device with `false` cannot hide credit card mode after sync.
- `js/sync.js` — refreshes Settings lists/forms and Credit Cards view immediately after applying remote/merged state, so synced settings are visible without reload.

**Verification:**
- `sync.js`, `settings.js`, and `core.js` syntax checks pass.
- Browser merge probe confirms categories from both devices are retained and `creditCardsEnabled` syncs as `true`.

## [v2.7] 2026-05-30 — Multi-device sync convergence and account email fix

**What changed:** Fixed a multi-device sync flaw where two devices could point at the same Google Drive file but keep different local data after repeated manual syncs.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — added a reconciliation pass in `syncFromDrive()` that merges missing `transactions`, `savingGoals`, `trips`, `recurringExpenses`, and `emis` by stable `id`, applies the merged state locally, and pushes the converged state back to Drive.
- `js/sync.js` — changed existing-file "Merge" connection flow to run reconciliation instead of overwriting the cloud file with only the current device's local state.
- `js/sync.js` — added `openid email profile` OAuth scopes and retries user email fetch from the metadata badge when `syncUserEmail` is blank.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `working.md` — documented the multi-device sync fix.

**Verification:**
- `sync.js` syntax check passes.
- Clean browser load still renders Cloud Sync status as `Offline` with `Connect Google Drive`.
- Reconciliation helper functions are registered in the browser.

## [v2.6] 2026-05-30 — Fix sync module boot crash from duplicate Client ID constant

**What changed:** Fixed a browser-fatal script parse error that prevented `sync.js` from loading at all, leaving Cloud Sync stuck on the hardcoded "Checking..." status in both normal and incognito sessions.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — renamed the duplicate top-level `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID` constant to `SYNC_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID`. `core.js` already declared `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID`, and classic browser scripts share one global lexical scope, so redeclaring the same `const` caused `Identifier 'DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID' has already been declared` and stopped every sync function from registering.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `working.md` — documented the regression and the fix.

**Verification:**
- Clean browser load now renders Cloud Sync status as `Offline` instead of `Checking...`.
- `#syncControlsContainer` now renders the `Connect Google Drive` button.
- `updateSyncStatus()` and `renderSyncControls()` are registered again from `sync.js`.

## [v2.5] 2026-05-30 — Sync UI boot fix: status panel, header icon & GIS timing

**What changed:** Fixed three compounding bugs that left the Cloud Sync panel permanently stuck on "Checking..." and the header icon invisible. Root cause was `updateSyncStatus` function declaration missing from `sync.js` (body existed but signature was deleted), `switchScreen('settings')` never refreshing sync UI on navigation, and the GIS SDK loading async before `initGoogleAuth` was called. Added inline boot patch to `index.html` as a cache-proof safety net.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — restored missing `function updateSyncStatus(status, detail = "")` declaration (function body was orphaned as top-level statements, causing ReferenceError on every call); restored `updateHeaderSyncIcon` as a separate correctly-ordered function; button now always visible (gray `cloud-off` when sync disabled, never `hidden`); `syncFromDrive()` guards early if GIS SDK not ready (sets `offline` cleanly instead of hanging); `initGoogleAuth()` no longer calls `updateSyncStatus` on SDK-not-ready (prevented circular crash at boot); added `window._trexGISReady` callback so `initGoogleAuth` fires the moment the GIS SDK finishes loading.
- `js/core.js` — `switchScreen('settings')` now calls `renderSyncControls()` + `updateSyncStatus()` every time Settings opens (previously only `renderSettingsLists()` was called, leaving sync panel stale); `window.onload` boot order corrected: `initLucideIcons()` before `updateHeaderSyncIcon()`; explicit `updateSyncStatus("offline")` called at boot when sync is disabled.
- `index.html` — removed `hidden` class from `#headerSyncBtn`; default icon changed from `cloud` to `cloud-off`; GIS script tag gains `onload` callback to trigger `_trexGISReady`; Client ID field placeholder now shows actual default Client ID with explanatory note; added inline `SYNC UI BOOT PATCH` script at end of `<body>` that calls `refreshSyncUI()` on `window.load` and wraps `switchScreen` — works as a cache-proof fallback even if `sync.js`/`core.js` are served stale from CDN/browser cache.

**Root causes fixed:**
1. `updateSyncStatus` function declaration deleted from `sync.js` → ReferenceError on every call → status frozen at hardcoded "Checking..."
2. `switchScreen('settings')` never called `renderSyncControls()` → `syncControlsContainer` always empty → no Connect button visible
3. GIS SDK loads `async defer` but `initGoogleAuth` only called on user action → returning users with `syncEnabled=true` hung on boot
4. `#headerSyncBtn` had `hidden` class in HTML and JS kept hiding it → icon never appeared

## [v2.4] 2026-05-30 — Silent sync engine, header status icon & account metadata

**What changed:** Replaced intrusive conflict modals with a fully silent background sync engine. Added a live cloud status icon to the app header. Added connected account and Drive file metadata display in the Settings panel. Hardcoded fallback OAuth Client ID. Extracted user email via userinfo endpoint post-OAuth.

**Files modified:**
- `js/sync.js` — rewritten `syncFromDrive()`: silent background engine; ongoing sync → remote overwrites arrays; initial linkage → deduplicate-merge by `id`; budget discrepancy → scoped `_showBudgetConflictModal()` only. Rewritten `applyRemoteState()`: preserves `googleClientId`, `syncUserEmail`, `syncDriveFileId`; forces `syncEnabled=true`; immediate UI re-render (no `window.location.reload()`). Rewritten `connectGoogleSync()`: obtains token first, checks `findSyncFileId()`, bypasses migration modal if no cloud file exists. Added `fetchGoogleUserEmail()`, `renderSyncMetaBadge()`, `updateHeaderSyncIcon()`, `_applyRemoteSilent()`, `_showBudgetConflictModal()`. Replaced `window.focus` listener with `visibilitychange` listener. Updated `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID` to `219866394954-pg9187uvcq3gu0c4l51728m1u1hojt0c.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
- `js/core.js` — added `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID` constant; added `syncUserEmail`, `syncDriveFileId`, `googleClientId` to default `state` and boot guards; added `updateHeaderSyncIcon()` call in `window.onload` after sync boot.
- `index.html` — added `#headerSyncBtn` cloud icon button in the app header navbar; added `#syncMetaBadge` account + file metadata panel inside Cloud Sync settings block.

**Features shipped:**
- **Silent sync engine** — no conflict modals; remote is source of truth on ongoing sync; deduplication merge on initial linkage.
- **Budget conflict modal** — scoped two-button modal for budget-only discrepancy (no full-screen takeover).
- **Header sync icon** — live `#headerSyncBtn` reflects `syncStatus`; taps trigger sync (idle) or open settings (error/offline).
- **Account metadata badge** — `#syncMetaBadge` shows connected Google email and Drive file ID in Settings.
- **Email fetch** — `fetchGoogleUserEmail()` hits `/oauth2/v3/userinfo` after OAuth; email persisted in `state.syncUserEmail`.
- **Tab visibility auto-sync** — `visibilitychange` listener replaces `window.focus`; syncs on every tab switch-back.
- **Silent upload on first connect** — if no Drive file exists, migration modal is bypassed entirely.
- **Connection config preservation** — `applyRemoteState()` never overwrites `googleClientId`, `syncUserEmail`, or `syncDriveFileId` from remote.

## [v2.3] 2026-05-30 — Google Drive Cloud Sync

**What changed:** Implemented full Google Drive `appDataFolder` sync engine with onboarding, migration, and reset capabilities.

**Files modified:**
- [js/sync.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/sync.js) — **new file**. Added: OAuth via GIS (`initGoogleAuth`, `getValidToken`); Drive REST API wrappers (`fetchWithRetry`, `findSyncFileId`, `createSyncFile`, `updateSyncFile`, `downloadSyncFile`); sync engine (`pushToDrive`, `syncFromDrive`, `applyRemoteState`); conflict modal (`showConflictModal`); status UI (`updateSyncStatus`); settings controls (`connectGoogleSync`, `disconnectGoogleSync`, `triggerManualSync`, `saveCustomClientId`, `renderSyncControls`); onboarding modal (`showOnboardingModal`, `checkAndShowOnboardingModal`); migration modal (`showMigrationModal`); reset (`resetSyncData`).
- [js/core.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/core.js) — added `syncEnabled`, `updatedAt`, `lastSyncedAt`, `syncStatus`, `googleClientId` to `state`; `saveStateToLocalStorage()` now sets `updatedAt` and triggers debounced `pushToDrive()`; `window.onload` calls `syncFromDrive()` and `checkAndShowOnboardingModal()`.
- [index.html](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/index.html) — added GIS and Drive API CDN script tags; injected Cloud Sync settings UI block (status indicator, Client ID field, sync controls container); relocated Cloud Sync section to appear directly below Base Engine Settings; registered `<script src="js/sync.js">`.

**Features shipped:**
- **Onboarding modal** — bottom-sheet warning fires 1.2 s after boot when sync is off; uses `sessionStorage` so it retriggers in every incognito session.
- **Migration modal** — shown before OAuth when local data exists; user chooses "Merge" (push local to Drive) or "Fresh Start" (pull cloud over local); cancel aborts auth.
- **Reset Sync** — deletes `trex_sync_v4.json` from Drive and disconnects; local data untouched.
- **Conflict resolution** — last-write-wins by `updatedAt`; conflict modal shown when both sides have data and timestamps diverge.
- **Exponential backoff** — `fetchWithRetry()` retries failed Drive calls at 2 s, 5 s, 15 s; token auto-refreshed on 401.

## [v2.2] 2026-05-29 — Clean onboarding and empty state handling for new users

**What changed:** Removed all dummy/mock transactions, mock saving goals, mock quick logs, and specific credit card defaults to ensure a clean slate onboarding experience for new users. Added robust empty state views, budget placeholder guidance, and safety checks for default payment references.

**Files modified:**
- [core.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/core.js) — cleared active/historical mock transactions, mock goals; reset budget defaults to 0 and cycle type/day to calendar-first defaults; simplified category and payment seeding.
- [dashboard.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/dashboard.js) — added prompt to set monthly budget if 0; hid forecast card if no budget/spend exists; cleared default quick logs array.
- [reports.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/reports.js) — added empty state verification and fallbacks for report charts and month-over-month view when transactions are empty.
- [settings.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/settings.js) — added budget field placeholder.
- [transactions.js](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/js/transactions.js) — added check to ensure referenced default payment method exists and is not archived before applying to category transaction forms.
- [README.md](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/README.md) — updated data persistence section to remove mock transactions reference.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](file:///c:/VS_Code/TReX/ARCHITECTURE.md) — updated state object template with new default onboarding values.

## [v2.1.1] 2026-05-29 — Fixed PWA manifest and optimized icon rendering

**What changed:** Replaced embedded PWA manifest data URI with external `manifest.json` file. Removed stale base64-encoded images from HTML. Added CSS optimizations for crisp icon rendering and white background removal.

**Files modified:**
- `index.html` — removed two embedded base64 image data URIs (header logo line 39, lock screen logo line 68); updated `<link rel="manifest">` to point to external `manifest.json` instead of data URI
- `manifest.json` — created new external PWA manifest file (replaces embedded data URI in HTML)
- `styles.css` — added high-quality icon rendering rules: `image-rendering: crisp-edges`, `image-rendering: pixelated`, `mix-blend-mode: multiply` for white background removal
- `assets/favicon.png` — replaced with new transparent icon (3D golden coin with green checkmark, no white background)

**What this fixes:**
- ✅ PWA icon no longer cached incorrectly (manifest now externally versioned)
- ✅ Favicon renders crisp/pixel-perfect (no more blur/interpolation artifacts)
- ✅ White background removed from icon display
- ✅ Reduced HTML file size (removed large base64 strings)
- ✅ Better cross-browser icon compatibility

**Migration notes:**
- Ensure `manifest.json` exists at project root alongside `index.html`
- Ensure `assets/favicon.png` is the transparent version (1.7MB+)
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see changes

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — updated title
- `FUNCTIONS.md` — updated title; marked `generateDynamicIcons()` as deprecated
- `CHANGELOG.md` — updated title and added this entry

**Migration notes:**
- The `assets/` directory must exist at the project root with `icon.png` inside it
- `generateDynamicIcons()` in `core.js` has been removed; no other code depends on it
